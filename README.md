# rag-healthqa

A lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer health-related questions using FAISS for vector search and HuggingFace Transformers for generation.

This project demonstrates how to build a simple pipeline for semantic retrieval + LLM-based answer synthesis â€” useful for medical knowledge bases, health tech QA, or education bots.

## Features

- Vector similarity search using FAISS
- Sentence embeddings with `sentence-transformers`
- LLM-based answer generation using `transformers` or OpenAI API
- Traced responses with input â†’ context â†’ answer flow

---

## ðŸ§  Stack

- Python 3.10+
- FAISS
- Sentence Transformers
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- OpenAI (or any local LLM)
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (optional)

## Sample Query

> **Prompt:** What are the symptoms of chronic kidney disease?

â†’ Retrieved context:
> "CKD symptoms include swelling, fatigue, and changes in urination."

â†’ LLM Response:
> "Common symptoms of chronic kidney disease are fatigue, swelling in legs or ankles, and frequent urination."

âœ… Grounded  
âœ… No hallucinations  
âœ… Uses top result
